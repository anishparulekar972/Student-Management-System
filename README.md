# Student-Management-System


This project is a Student Information Management System developed using the Linked List data structure. The main aim of this system is to create an efficient and reliable way to store, manage, and retrieve student records while reducing manual work and saving time.

The system stores student details such as Student ID (Roll ID), First Name, Last Name, Address, Phone Number, and Percentage. It allows the admin to insert, delete, search, and display student records easily. By using a linked list, the system handles dynamic data efficiently without wasting memory.

This project was developed by a group of two students, where both members contributed equally. We first researched the topic using internet resources, books, and notes provided by the teacher. After gaining basic understanding, we decided to implement a Student Information Management System using linked lists.

The system also includes a login feature (username and password) for admin security. The objective is to help the admin manage student records quickly and allow easy access to student information when needed.

Overall, this project helps:

Reduce manual effort in record keeping

Increase speed and efficiency

Maintain student data in an organized manner

Fetch student details within seconds
